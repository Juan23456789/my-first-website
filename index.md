<h1>Meme explination</h1>
<p>Memes' are humorous images, videos, pieces of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.</p>
<p>I like memes because they make me laugh and may cheer me up sometimes <p>
<p>Humor is the quality of being amusing or comic, especially as expressed in literature or speech.<p>
<p> 
Laughter is primitive, an unconscious vocalization, Provine says. "In laughter we emit sounds and express emotions that come from deep within our biologic being -- grunts and cackles from our animal unconscious," he writes. Do you seem to laugh more than others? It's likely genetic, he explains.<p>
<h2>What are emotions </h2>
</p> Primary emotions such as love, joy, surprise, anger, and sadness can then be further broken down into secondary emotions. Love, for example, consists of secondary emotions, such as affection and longing. These secondary emotions might then be broken down still further into what are known as tertiary emotions.</p>
